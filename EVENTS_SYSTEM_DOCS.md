## 📅 Calendar Integration

### How It Works

The system generates calendar files in two formats:

**1. Google Calendar**
- Direct link to Google Calendar
- Opens in new tab
- Pre-fills all event details
- One-click add

**2. .ics File (Universal)**
- Download calendar file
- Works with:
  - Apple Calendar
  - Microsoft Outlook
  - Yahoo Calendar
  - Any calendar app supporting .ics

### What Gets Synced

- **Event Title** (with subtitle)
- **Start Date & Time**
- **End Date & Time**  
- **Location** (full address)
- **Description** (complete text)
- **Status**: Confirmed

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Generate .ics file
const handleDownloadICS = () => {
  const icsContent = generateICS(event);
  // Creates downloadable file
};

// Open Google Calendar
const handleGoogleCalendar = () => {
  const url = generateGoogleCalendarUrl(event);
  window.open(url, '_blank');
};
```
